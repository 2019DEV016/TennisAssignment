# TennisAssignment

Overview:-
I have developed a simple Tennis game application in iOS using swift language.I also have added couple of test cases.

System Requirements-
MacOS, Xcode(version 9.3 and above) with working simulator

How to Play:-

1] Run application
2] There are two play buttons for each player. Click on any button. Scores will get reflected on screen.

I have used following rules for developing the assignment-

•Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40
•If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game, however there are special rules.
•If both have 40 the players are deuce.
  a. If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball.
  b. If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
  c. If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.

•A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
•The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “love”, “fifteen”, “thirty”, and “fourty” respectively.
•If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “deuce”.
•If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is “advantage” for the player in the lead.
